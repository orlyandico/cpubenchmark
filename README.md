This is a set of Jupyter notebooks for correlating CPU performance across (many) generations.

The first notebook downloads and processes SPECint 2017, 2006, and 2000, cross-correlates, and derives SPECint95. Now you can do a (more or less) apples-to-apples comparison of your fancy Macbook Pro to the Sun Ultra 1 of your youth.

The second notebook downloads and processes the SAP SD2 Tier (Sales and Distribution) benchmark, and attempts to find any correlation between SAPS and SPEC. Spoiler: SAPS SD2 in its current form is basically a CPU benchmark.
